Feature: Set Column Properties
  As a Data Packager
  I want to describe the meaning and structure of the data
  So that it can be validated and Data Consumers can understand and use it

  RULES
  =====

  - Column properties are defined in http://frictionlessdata.io/specs/table-schema/
  - The `name`, `type` and `format` can be pre-populated using Guess Column Properties
  - A `name` must be entered for each column. `name` will be defaulted from the value in the first row
  - The `title` and `description` are optional
  - Each `type` has a `format` of `default` and may have a limited set of other formats
  - Data of a certain `type` may have extra properties e.g. `groupChar` for `number`
  - Each column may have one or more `constraints` to further restrict the valid values that can be entered into a column. Constraints can vary by `type`
  - "Set Column Properties" for the current column can be invoked from the menu, toolbar or shortcut

  LATER
  =====

  - `missingValues` can be set per column

  Background:
    Given Data Curator is open
    And the cursor should be in the new table

  @impl
  Scenario Outline: Set Column Properties for the current column
    When "Column Properties" is invoked using the "<type>": "<sequence>"
    Then the "Column Properties" panel should be displayed
    Examples:
      | type                       | sequence                     |
      | toolbar menu button        | Column                       |
      | application menu selection | Tools->Set Column Properties |

  Scenario: Set Column Properties for the current column
    When "Column Properties" is invoked
    Then the "Column Properties" panel should be displayed
    When the "Column" properties are entered as
      | Name        | A Good name      |
      | Title       | This is a title  |
      | Description | description text |
      | RDF Type    | rdf value        |
#    And column property values should be accepted and validated
#    And the values should be saved as they are entered
